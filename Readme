To run this project, you will need to follow these steps:

Install YOLOv7 by following the instructions in the 'Train_the_model.ipynb' file.
(Optional) You can also install COCO start checkpoints if you wish to retrain the model. If not, our trained weights are included in the file 'best.pt'

Place the following folders and files inside the YOLOv7 folder (which are included in the repo):
a. s1
b. s2
c. anas
d. anas1
e. Your dataset challenge, but please rename it to 'Challenge' and remove any spaces in the folder names (i.e. 'Scene 1' should be 'Scene1')
f. Our weight file for predicting potholes 'best.pt'

The 'Train_the_model.ipynb' file is used for training the model.
The 'predict_Potholes_for_the_hackthon_data.ipynb' file is used for detecting bounding boxes on the images of the challenge.
The '3D_reconstruction.ipynb' file is used for creating 3D reconstructions (a GPU is required for this step).
The 'potholes_size_and_depth_detection.ipynb' file is the main file for detecting the depth and size of the potholes.
