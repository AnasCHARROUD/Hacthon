Please refer to the video 'Explanation of the hacthon project' which contain everything to run the project.


TO RUN THIS PROJECT YOU WILL NEED:

1-----------------------
Install yolov7 (look at Train_the_model.ipynb)
to see the instruction.

(optional) install coco strt checkpoints if you want to re train the model. Else the our trained weights are in file 'best.pt' 

2--------------------
include the folowing folder/file inside the yolov7 folder
    1- s1
    2- s2
    3- anas
    4- anas1
    5- YOUR DATASET CHALLENGE. BUT PLEASE RENAME IT 'Challenge' and inside the folder remove space 'Scene 1' to 'Scene1' same thing with scene2
    6- Our weight to predict the potholes 'best.pt'




Files description.

Train_the_model.ipynb :        is to train the model

predict_Potholes_for_the_hackthon_data.ipynb:   is to detecting bounding box on the images of the challenge

3D_reconstruction.ipynb :   is to make 3D reconstruction (you need gpu)

potholes_size_and_depth_detecetion.ipynb :      is the main file to detect potholes depth and size.
